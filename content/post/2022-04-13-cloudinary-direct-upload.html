title: Direct Image Upload Made Easy
excerpt: Handling user uploaded images and other files on your website can be a time
  consuming task. As images grow larger, uploading and processing them becomes more
  and more complex. For example, common upload issues for images and other files may
  relate to browser limitations, server configuration issues, memory and timeout issues.
  Specifically, handling user uploaded images on your website can be a hassle. In
  this post, we'll show how Cloudinary's cloud-based image management service can
  help you turn user uploading into a lightweight operation that bypasses your servers
  altogether.
